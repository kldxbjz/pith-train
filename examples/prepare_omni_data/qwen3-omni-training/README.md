# Qwen3-Omni training data preparation

This recipe prepares real train/validation corpora, not hand-written fixtures.
Defaults are deliberately small: **16 train + 4 validation records per modality**
(80 records with all four modalities). Increase the limits in `config.json` to
prepare more data through the same path. No model weights or GPU are required.

## Sources and splits

| Modality | Source | Train / validation policy |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Text | [DCLM Baseline](https://huggingface.co/datasets/mlfoundations/dclm-baseline-1.0) | Stable SHA-256 split of normalized documents; 10% held out before selection |
| Image | [COCO Karpathy](https://huggingface.co/datasets/yerevann/coco-karpathy) | Published train / validation splits, first original caption per image |
| Audio | [LibriSpeech](https://www.openslr.org/12) via [OpenSLR on HF](https://huggingface.co/datasets/openslr/librispeech_asr) | train-clean-100 / dev-clean, original transcripts |
| Video | [MSVD](https://huggingface.co/datasets/VLM2Vec/MSVD) | Published train / validation splits, first original caption per clip |

The config pins every dataset revision and the official Omni processor revision.
Test splits are never selected. Shared image IDs, audio speakers and original
video IDs cannot cross the selected train/validation boundary. Duplicate sample
IDs and duplicate media bytes are rejected. DCLM's holdout is by exact normalized
document, not a semantic near-duplicate filter. This is a development training
corpus, not a claim to reproduce Qwen's original data mixture or evaluate general
model quality. Upstream source/asset terms continue to apply.

COCO images come from its public S3 bucket over HTTPS. Captions/transcripts are
the source annotations; the preparation code does not invent replacement text.
The MSVD adapter is for visual captioning. Videos with audio tracks are rejected;
audio/video synchronization and Talker targets require a later data contract.

## Prepare only what the model supports

From an installed PithTrain environment with the `omni-data` extra:

```bash
python examples/prepare_omni_data/qwen3-omni-training/script.py prepare \
  --stage video --output workspace/datasets/omni-training
```

Stages are cumulative, defined in the config:

| Stage | Enabled inputs |
| --- | --- |
| `text` | Text |
| `image` | Text + image |
| `audio` | Text + image + audio |
| `video` | Text + image + audio + visual video |

Use `--stage text` or another earlier stage to avoid fetching later modalities.
A full prepared bundle can also serve earlier-stage loaders without preparing
another copy. Loading an unavailable stage fails; media is never silently removed
from a sample to make it compatible. The defaults do not enable synchronized
audio-in-video merely because `video` is enabled.

## Scale up without rewriting the loader

Copy `config.json` and change:

- `samples_per_modality.train` / `.validation`: accepted records per modality.
- `max_scan_per_modality`: scanning budget; raise it along with sample counts.
- Source `files`: add pinned shard paths or globs. Audio already lists all
  train-clean-100 shards; text starts with one DCLM shard.
- `records_per_shard`: maximum JSONL records (and text documents) per output shard.
- `sampling_weights`: relative probabilities of the enabled training modalities.
- `batch`: sequence length, image size, audio duration and video sampling limits.
  Optional `max_text_chars` defaults to 20000 for preparation.

Pass the copied config with `--config` and choose a **new output directory**.
Changing limits/stages in an existing output is rejected rather than mixing old
and new files. Selection is deterministic source order up to the requested count;
the runtime sampler supplies shuffling/mixture. Small subsets are not statistically
representative of the full sources (e.g. early LibriSpeech records share a speaker).

Source data is read incrementally. Parquet downloads are limited to needed row
groups, which may contain more records than requested. DCLM caches a bounded
document prefix per selected shard. Source cache files have hashes and are reused
after interruption. `--cache` chooses their location. To rebuild without network:

```bash
HF_HUB_OFFLINE=1 python examples/prepare_omni_data/qwen3-omni-training/script.py prepare \
  --offline --stage video --output workspace/datasets/omni-training-rebuilt
```

An interrupted output has no usable completion marker/checksum pair. Rerunning
reuses checked source/media files and deterministically rebuilds manifests; it
does not append duplicate samples. Offline mode fails on an uncached source.
Expected media decode/length failures go to `rejected.jsonl`, then preparation
continues until the quota is met. Network/cache-integrity failures stop the run.
Exhausting the scan budget raises an error, never a false success with fewer data.

## Outputs and runtime use

```text
bundle.json              # completed catalog, pins, counts, package versions
recipe.json              # effective recipe and enabled stage
checksums.sha256         # catalog, manifests, tokens, rejection log and accepted media
rejected.jsonl           # skipped IDs and reasons
train/<modality>-*.jsonl
validation/<modality>-*.jsonl
media/<modality>/<sha256>.*
tokens/train/*.bin       # existing dense text loader format
tokens/validation/*.bin  # held-out text, in a separate directory
```

The JSONL records retain source IDs, grouping, split, media hash and validated
input/target token counts. Media paths are relative to the bundle root, so moving
the whole bundle does not break them. Preparation runs the actual Omni processor
on **every accepted record**, rejecting overlong expanded sequences rather than
truncating media tokens. It does not persist huge precomputed pixel/audio tensors.

Text `.bin` output reuses `Worker`/`Writer` and the pinned tokenizer's EOS. Point
existing text pretraining at **`tokens/train` only**; never the parent containing
both train and validation. Dense `.bin` retains the existing cross-document
next-token behavior. Multimodal JSONL uses separate padded sequences with media
targets masked out. These are deliberately different data layouts.
Both use the real Omni tokenizer: a reduced training model must retain its
152064-entry vocabulary. A 256-entry synthetic comparison fixture cannot consume
these IDs; changing model depth/width does not require changing the tokenizer.

`create_omni_dataloader` in `pithtrain/modules/qwen3_omni_data.py` reads a bundle,
selects a stage/split and returns `Qwen3OmniBatch` values. It checks catalog and
selected manifest hashes. JSONL shards are indexed by byte offset; the runtime
keeps offsets/indices, not all document text, in memory.

Training sampling is **weighted with replacement**. It is deterministic for
seed, epoch and global sample position. `rank`/`world_size` mean **data-parallel**
rank/size, not EP or PP. `start_sample` is the globally consumed sample count;
record that count after completed steps, not a prefetched iterator position.
Each DP rank receives different draw positions; replacement can intentionally
repeat a record. Set `num_samples` to a multiple of data world size. Validation
visits each selected record once and currently uses one data rank.

```bash
python examples/prepare_omni_data/qwen3-omni-training/script.py check \
  --data workspace/datasets/omni-training \
  --report workspace/omni-training-batches.json
```

This verifies all bundle hashes and exercises train/validation loaders for every
available stage. Native Omni, DualPipeV media routing, global valid-target loss
normalization and optimizer updates are still model-integration work; this
command does not claim to train a model.

## Orchard storage

Prepare a small bundle in WSL; keep durable versions in the user's GCS bucket.
The source cache is reproducible working data and is not included in publication.
Archives contain only checksum-listed files, have deterministic metadata, and
use their SHA-256 as the GCS object name. Publishing never overwrites an object.

```bash
python examples/prepare_omni_data/qwen3-omni-training/script.py publish \
  --data workspace/datasets/omni-training \
  --prefix gs://YOUR_BUCKET/pith-train/datasets/omni-training
```

Inside an **allocated compute job**, stage the returned `.tar` URI to its local
SSD. Run staging once per node before starting that node's training processes:

```bash
test -n "${SLURM_JOB_ID:-}"  # do not stage corpora on the login node
python examples/prepare_omni_data/qwen3-omni-training/script.py stage \
  --uri gs://YOUR_BUCKET/pith-train/datasets/omni-training/ARCHIVE_SHA256.tar \
  --output /tmp/omni-data-$SLURM_JOB_ID
```

Staging checks the archive SHA-256, safely extracts regular files, then checks
every payload hash before exposing the final directory. Existing destinations
are never overwritten. Keep source caches and larger preparation output on
allocated-node `/tmp` too; do not put corpora in `/home` or shared `/project`.
GCS publishing/staging uses the already-authenticated `gcloud` CLI. The repo
contains no account identity or credentials. Pure media transfer/verification
does not require a model download.
